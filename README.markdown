bbot
====

This is a framework for higher-level configuration of
[BuildBot](http://trac.buildbot.net/) masters, used by
[BoostPro Computing](http://boostpro.com) for its internal testing and
by the [Ryppl](http://ryppl.org) project.

The goal is to efficiently and expressively manage pools of slaves
whose resources can be distributed across a variety of build and test
jobs.

Why "bbot?" basically, it's short.
